> **Bringing intelligence into the real world.**  
> This project explores **Physical AI** – AI that doesn't just live in code, but sees, moves, learns, and interacts through a physical body. Focusing on **embodied intelligence** and **humanoid robots**, we aim to build systems that truly understand the world by living and acting in it.
