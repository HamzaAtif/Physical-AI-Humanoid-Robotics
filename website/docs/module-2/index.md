## Introduction to Digital Twins

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning, and reasoning to help make decisions.

### Benefits of Digital Twins in Robotics

- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminate need for physical prototypes
- **Safety**: Test dangerous scenarios in safe environments
- **Speed**: Accelerate development and testing cycles
- **Validation**: Verify algorithms before deployment
- **Optimization**: Tune parameters in controlled environments

### Simulation Platforms

This module covers two leading simulation platforms:
- **Gazebo**: Open-source robotics simulator with realistic physics
- **Unity**: Game engine adapted for robotics simulation with rich graphics

Let's explore these platforms in detail.
