# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Docusaurus-First Documentation
Use Docusaurus 3+ with MDX for rich content (code blocks, embeds, interactive elements); All content must be in MDX format to support interactive elements and proper rendering. This ensures consistent, professional presentation across all course materials.

### Clean, Professional Structure
Maintain clean, professional docs structure with sidebar navigation and optional versioning; Navigation must be intuitive and consistent across all modules. The course website must provide easy access to all content through well-organized navigation.

### Content Richness with Technical Accuracy
All modules/chapters must include proper headings, code examples, diagrams, quizzes, exercises, and ROS 2 code snippets where relevant; Technical accuracy is paramount for robotics/AI topics. Educational content must be both engaging and technically precise.

### Mobile-Friendly Accessibility
All content must be mobile-friendly, accessible, and fast-loading; Website must meet WCAG accessibility standards and load efficiently on all devices. The course materials must be accessible to learners regardless of device or accessibility needs.

### English Language Standards
All content must be in English with proper grammar and technical terminology; English must be clear, concise, and technically accurate. This ensures universal understanding among international learners.

### Git-Friendly Development
Proper git practices: meaningful commits, comprehensive README, GitHub Actions for automated deployment; All changes must be tracked with clear commit messages following conventional commits. Version control must maintain clean history and enable collaboration.

## Technology Stack Requirements
Required technology stack: Docusaurus 3+, Node.js, React, MDX, GitHub Pages for deployment; All dependencies must be properly versioned and documented. The technology choices must support the educational goals and deployment requirements.

## Development Workflow
Standard workflow: Create branch → Develop content → Test locally → PR review → Deploy via GitHub Actions; All changes must be reviewed before merging to main branch. This ensures quality control and collaborative development practices.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development practices; All PRs must comply with these principles; Changes to constitution require team approval and documentation update. The principles herein are binding for all contributors to the project.
