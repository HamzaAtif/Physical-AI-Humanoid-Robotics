## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robotic applications. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robotic behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

### Key Features of ROS 2

- **Distributed Computing**: ROS 2 supports communication between processes running on the same system or across multiple systems.
- **Language Independence**: Develop nodes in multiple languages including C++, Python, and others.
- **Real-time Support**: Improved real-time capabilities compared to ROS 1.
- **Security**: Built-in security features for safe robotic operations.
- **Quality of Service**: Configurable communication policies for different application needs.

Let's dive deeper into the theoretical foundations of ROS 2.
